Hello Kishor
Good Morning

I am Subba Reddy. I have worked on the Payment Module of the Online Shop Project.

I have created a microservice(payment-service) using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

The "Payment-Service" has been configured to run on port 9093. It registers with the Discovery Server
by the same name that is "Payment-Service". 

This service has been configured to use FeignClient to interact or communicate with the other 
microservices, for suppose, the DB Microservice.

One of the REST ENDPOINT is configured to accept the Cart Details, which would then render the payment 
form.

The payment form has three payment options Credit Card, Debit Card and Netbanking.

Depending on the user's selection the payment form inputs would be rendered. The "Credit card"
option is selected on page load by default.

Once the user enters the card details on the payment form and progresses with the payment, all the
details are sent to the other REST Endpoint which process the user's payment. And returns the status of
transaction. If the transaction is successful, we send the data to CRUD microservice which in turn
would save the records in the "ProductsCustomers" table.

Disclaimer
==========

1. I have built the front-end for the "Payment-Service" using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

2. As we could not integrate the cart service and test, I have simulated the data model of the cart 
and have created a form for the very purpose.
{
"customerId": 12345,
"amount": 3500,
"productList" : [
    {
        "productId": 12,
        "productName": "Samsung",
        "itemId": 100,
        "price": 50
    },
    {
        "productId": 13,
        "productName": "Nokia",
        "itemId": 100,
        "price": 50
    },
    {
        "productId": 14,
        "productName": "Apple",
        "itemId": 100,
        "price": 50
    }
  ]
}
3. Rest of the team had built using Angular for the front-end but I decided to take this approach as the 
learning curve was steep for me.

4. I am simulating the success/failure scenarios for payments as we could not integrate with the common 
CRUD microservice.
